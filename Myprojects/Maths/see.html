		Sometimes it's right on the box of rice mix-the high altitude version of cooking instructions. Usually this means that your rice will have to cook a little bit longer if you are in Denver or at the top of Mount Everest. Of course that's just a joke. No one cooks rice at the top of Everest. But why are the instructions even different? Why does it matter where you cook? The answer has to do with boiling water.
	    </p>
		<p>
		You ask some people on the street about the boiling temperature of water. Some might say 212°F or even better 100°C-but that's not always true. As you increase your altitude above sea level, the boiling point of water decreases by about 1°F for every 500 feet increase. That means your water in Denver is going to be 203°F and this will have an impact on your cooking. But why?

			It's really true what people say about English politeness: It's everywhere. When squeezing past someone on a narrow space, people say 'sorry'. When getting off a bus, English passengers say 'thank you' to the driver. In Germany, people would never dream of doing this: bus drivers are just doing their job! I used to think the German way; I was in Britain for a few years. I understood that there were more polite ways of treating people and I began to adopt some of those way too!
		</p>
		<p>
			When people buy something in a shop, both customer and shop assistant usually thank each other twice or more. In Germany, it would be unusual to hear more than one 'thank you' in such a conversation. British students thank their lectures when leaving the room. English employers thank their employees for doing their jobs, but Germans think that paying their workers money is already thanks enough!
		</p>
		<p>
			But there is another side to British politeness. One word that comes to mind here is 'artificial'. Although it is enjoyable to talk with friendly people, it has often made me wonder what the English really think. In fact, this confused me during my stay in England. Everyone at the University I attended seemed to like me and people in my class were kind and friendly but I found it hard to understand who my friend was really and who was just being polite.
		</p>
		<p>
			I must say that British politeness is a little puzzling to me. For example, I often wonder why the English lose it when they drink too much. And then I think: maybe, drinking is good excuse for being rude once in a while. After all, having to be polite all the time can be stressful, right?

    <p>
    	Answer:<b>Social media platforms have revolutionized the way students approach their studies by providing an array of tools and resources that enhance learning experiences. These platforms facilitate instant access to a vast amount of information, enabling students to conduct research, find academic articles, and participate in online discussions with peers and experts. By joining study groups and academic communities on platforms like Facebook, Reddit, and LinkedIn, students can share knowledge, seek advice, and collaborate on projects, fostering a collaborative learning environment that transcends geographical boundaries.<br><br>

        Moreover, social media platforms offer unique opportunities for interactive and engaging learning. Educational content creators use platforms like YouTube and Instagram to share tutorials, explanatory videos, and infographics, making complex subjects more accessible and understandable. The use of hashtags and dedicated channels allows students to follow specific topics and stay updated with the latest developments in their fields of interest. This dynamic and interactive approach to learning helps in keeping students motivated and engaged, ultimately contributing to more effective and enjoyable study sessions.</b>

                            Subject: Urgent Need to Fix Roads in Budanilkhantha<br><br>

Dear Editor,<br><br>

I am writing to complain about the terrible condition of the roads in our locality, Budanilkhantha. We have informed the municipal authorities many times, but nothing has been done so far.<br><br>

First, the roads have numerous potholes and rough patches. This makes it very dangerous for drivers and pedestrians. The poor condition of the roads also damages cars, costing residents a lot of money for repairs.<br><br>

Second, there is no proper drainage system in the place. During the rainy season, water accumulates on the roads, making it hard for people to move around safely. This stagnant water also becomes a breeding ground for mosquitoes, posing significant health risks to the community.<br><br>

To solve these problems, I suggest the authorities take immediate action to repair the roads and conduct regular inspections to fill the potholes. Improving the drainage system will also prevent waterlogging and reduce health risks.<br><br>

In addition, better street lighting should be installed to enhance visibility at night and ensure the safety of all road users. Proper signage and road markings will also help in organizing traffic and preventing accidents.<br><br>

I hope this letter will bring the authorities' attention to this serious issue and prompt them to take quick action for the well-being of our community.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
