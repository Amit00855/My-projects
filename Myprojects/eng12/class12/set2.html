			<h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>How to stay fit, happy and healthy</b></h3>
			<p>
			If you’ve been listening to the news you already know about our national obesity levels rising by the day. It has never been more important to watch what you are eating and to get an adequate amount of exercise and sleep to keep yourself fit and healthy. Though it may feel like really hard work at first, once you adopt an exercise routine and start to adapt to a new situation, you’ll forget you ever did things differently. Here are the top four top <b>adjustments</b> you could make make:
			</p>
			<p>
			Sleep is huge and almost a third of the US population doesn’t get near enough to help them stay physically and mentally healthy. If you are sleep <b>deprived</b>, try changing your habits in order to get a full eight hours every night.
			</p>
			<p>
		      Look at what you’re eating now and make changes where you see fit. If you are <b>susceptible</b> to snacking, keep a piece of fruit or a few nuts at hand. The key is to eat small meals throughout the day. Reduce portion sizes, remove white bread and replace with whole grains and make sure each meal contains at least one portion of fruit and – or vegetables. Healthy food doesn’t have to be expensive in the least bit, and you can get an <b>abundance</b> of low priced fruit and veggies, like apples, bananas, potatoes and peas.
			</p>
			<p>
			Take a look at your current lifestyle and make a small list of everything you do that is not good for your health. This could be anything, from eating too much junk food or drinking too much caffeine, to smoking or drinking. Start the process of breaking these habits one by one. Some will be easy, while others may take months or maybe years to get rid of and <b>eradicate</b> completely from your life, but the sooner you start fighting, the better.
			</p>
			<p>
			Some addictions (like smoking, drugs or alcohol) are <b>incredibly</b> bad not only to your health, but also to your pocketbook. If you smoke and/or drink, start by cutting back on how many drinks you have, or cigarettes you smoke, in a day, and if necessary, seek medical advice and assistance to make further steps towards stopping completely.
			</p>
			<p>
			We all should be doing at least 30 minutes of exercise, 3 to 4 or more times a week, to maintain good health and keep fit. This can be pretty much anything that is physical, like walking, cycling, running, swimming to weightlifting, etc. This too does not have to be expensive, and you can get a great work out without joining any costly gyms. Most of these exercises are inexpensive, and just doing a <b>cardiovascular</b> exercise, like walking, jogging, or walking on a treadmill a few times a week will do your body (and heart) good.

            		a)&nbsp;The people in the neighborhood were surprised because the young man and his wife, who were educated and from the city, adapted to the traditional rural way of life and worked alongside their family without hesitation. Their modern lifestyle was expected to clash with rural expectations, but instead, they embraced it.<br><br>

            		b)&nbsp;The author humorously contrasts the prestige associated with 'America' as a land of opportunity and success, while 'the USA' is used more informally, showing how people exaggerate the importance of having relatives abroad. The author's playful use of the terms highlights the inflated pride and expectations tied to living or studying in the US.<br><br> 

            		c)&nbsp;These lines express hope for unity and harmony among people. The poet envisions a future where people's lives are in sync ("rhyme"), and they work together to achieve a fruitful, peaceful existence ("loving harvest") that transcends space and time, signifying cooperation across generations and distances.<br><br>

            		d)&nbsp;The central idea of the essay is the distinction between knowledge and wisdom. Russell argues that knowledge, or the accumulation of facts, is not enough on its own. Wisdom involves the use of knowledge in a way that benefits humanity and promotes well-being, by considering ethical implications, foresight, and the broader consequences of actions.<br><br>

            		e)&nbsp;History is a major contested issue because different groups, nations, and ideologies interpret historical events differently, often using them to justify present actions or beliefs. This can lead to conflicts over what is considered 'true' or significant in history, making it a source of political and social tension in the modern world.

            	<p>
            		a)&nbsp;In A Matter of Husbands, the Famous Actress is a charming, confident, and manipulative woman who knows how to use her beauty and wit to influence others, especially men. She is glamorous, worldly, and skilled in the art of persuasion. When the Earnest Young Woman accuses her of being involved with her husband, the Famous Actress craftily twists the situation, convincing the Young Woman that her husband’s apparent infatuation is just part of a clever ploy to make his wife more attentive and affectionate.<br><br>

                        The Famous Actress is composed, strategic, and manipulative, whereas the Earnest Young Woman is innocent, emotional, and trusting. The Earnest Young Woman believes in the sincerity of relationships, whereas the Famous Actress sees them as games to be played. This difference highlights the contrast between naivety and experienced cunning in the play.<br><br>

            		b)&nbsp;In A Day, Emily Dickinson portrays the beauty and mystery of a single day’s progression from dawn to dusk, symbolizing the cycle of life and death. The poem starts with a description of sunrise, where the speaker captures the brilliance of the morning as it lights up the hills and awakens nature. The imagery of children playing and birds singing paints a picture of innocence and joy.<br><br>

                        As the day unfolds, the poem transitions from the lively, vibrant morning to the quieter, more solemn tone of sunset. The imagery shifts as the sun sinks, symbolizing the end of life and the passage of time. Dickinson subtly contrasts the beginning of the day with its inevitable end, offering a philosophical reflection on life’s transience. In essence, the poem explores the journey from birth to death, capturing both the beauty and fragility of life.

            		One of the most useful things I have ever learned is the importance of time management. Understanding how to allocate time effectively has had a significant impact on my personal and professional life. It has taught me how to prioritize tasks, set realistic goals, and maintain a balance between work, education, and leisure. By organizing my day in advance, I can reduce stress, stay productive, and make time for important activities that contribute to my overall well-being.<br><br>

                        Time management has also helped me avoid procrastination. I’ve learned that breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps makes large projects seem less overwhelming, and tackling them one at a time prevents me from feeling pressured. This skill has proven to be crucial not only in meeting deadlines but also in improving my efficiency and focus. As a result, I am able to stay on top of my responsibilities and still enjoy free time without feeling guilty or rushed.<br><br>

                        In the long run, mastering time management has helped me develop self-discipline and a sense of accomplishment. By managing my time wisely, I’ve created space for growth, learning, and new experiences, all while staying in control of my schedule. This skill continues to benefit me in all aspects of life.

                  Hi Nitesh,<br><br>

                  It’s great to hear that your friends are visiting my village! There are several interesting places they can explore during their stay. One of the must-visit spots is the old temple on the hill, which has a fascinating history dating back hundreds of years. There’s also the local museum that showcases our village’s rich cultural heritage, including ancient artifacts and historical exhibits.<br><br>

                  For a bit of nature, they can head to the nearby lake, where they’ll enjoy peaceful surroundings and beautiful views. If they’re interested in history, the old fort a little outside the village is another excellent option. It’s a great spot to learn about the area's past and take in some scenic landscapes.<br><br>

                  As for getting around, I’d recommend renting a bike or going on foot for the more accessible spots, like the temple and the museum. However, for places like the fort, a car would be more convenient as it's a bit far. The local buses are also reliable and a good option for budget travel.<br><br>

                  Let me know if they need any more info!<br><br>

            	<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Impact of Studying Abroad on Nepalese Students and the Country</h3>

                  In recent years, an increasing number of Nepalese students have chosen to pursue their education abroad. This trend brings both benefits and drawbacks to the students and the country. While studying abroad offers significant opportunities for personal and professional growth, it also presents challenges that can affect the nation as a whole.<br><br>

                  One of the primary benefits for students studying abroad is exposure to high-quality education and advanced learning environments. Countries like the US, UK, Australia, and Canada offer access to state-of-the-art facilities, diverse curricula, and research opportunities that are often unavailable in Nepal. This exposure not only enhances students' skills but also broadens their perspectives, preparing them for global careers. Additionally, studying in multicultural environments helps students develop cultural awareness and language proficiency, making them more adaptable and competitive in the international job market.<br><br>

                  For Nepal, the advantages of this trend can be seen when students return home with the knowledge, expertise, and skills acquired abroad. These students can contribute to the country’s development in various sectors, from technology and medicine to education and business. Furthermore, students abroad often send remittances home, which boosts the economy and provides financial support to families.<br><br>

                  However, the trend of studying abroad also has drawbacks. One significant issue is the "brain drain," where a large number of skilled graduates choose to remain abroad for better job opportunities. This deprives Nepal of the talents and expertise needed to drive national progress. Moreover, many families face financial strain as the cost of studying abroad can be prohibitive, leading to debt and long-term economic challenges.<br><br>

                  In conclusion, while studying abroad offers immense benefits to students and Nepal, it also presents challenges, particularly in terms of the potential loss of skilled professionals. Encouraging students to return and contribute to the country’s growth could help mitigate the negative effects of this trend.
