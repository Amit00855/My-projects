				There is quite a debate on whether or not computers have positively affected education. Some proponents of computers in school argue the fact that computers are vast in the supply of resources as well as the fact that computers dominate society and will continue to do so. Opponents of computers in education take the position of experiencing things actually, and not just on a computer screen, a reality versus virtual reality argument. In addition, there is the aspect of time involved with using a computer as opposed to interaction with actual living things. Computers have in many ways enhanced education but it has also weakened other skills taught in school as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first skill lost is obvious with the use of the word processing programmes today. Of course they are convenient for typing papers because of the neatness and uniformity they provide as opposed to hand writing. Computers also make it easy to correct mistakes without using white out or scratching out words. However, it is discouraging children to learn how to spell correctly, use correct grammar and in some word processing programmes use more vibrant and exciting words.

            <a class="btn btn-success" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseExample2" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
            View Answer</a>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample2">
            <div class="card card-body">
            	<p>
            	a)&nbsp;In The Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe, the repeated description of the "low, dull, quick sound—much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton" is very important. The narrator keeps hearing this sound after he kills the old man, and it makes him more and more nervous. He thinks it is the sound of the old man's heart still beating, but it’s really just his own guilt and fear growing inside him.<br><br>

                This sound doesn’t make the narrator commit the murder. Instead, it shows up after the crime, almost like a reminder of what he has done. The more he hears it, the more anxious and paranoid he becomes, until he can’t take it anymore and confesses to the crime.<br><br>

                So, the sound represents his guilt, growing louder in his mind and driving him to admit what he did.<br><br>

            	b)&nbsp;In the fairy tale Hansel and Gretel, Hansel drops shiny pebbles on the way to the forest because he wants to find his way back home. He overhears his stepmother and father planning to abandon him and his sister, Gretel, in the forest because they cannot afford to feed them. To prevent getting lost, Hansel collects shiny white pebbles that will shine in the moonlight. He drops them along the path as they walk, creating a trail they can follow back to their house after being left in the woods.<br><br>

            	c)&nbsp;In The Children Who Wait, children like Tammy are waiting for adoption because they are often considered "hard to place" in the traditional adoption system. These children may be older, have special needs, come from minority backgrounds, or have experienced trauma, making them less likely to be adopted compared to younger, healthier children.

                The book highlights the challenges of the adoption process and the biases within the system that make it difficult for children like Tammy to find permanent, loving homes. Families may hesitate to adopt children with more complex needs, leaving many of these children waiting longer for adoption.<br><br>

            	d)&nbsp;In About Love by Anton Chekhov, the narrator, Alyohin, reflects on the conflict between his life of hard work and the desire for a more refined, intellectual existence. Alyohin is a farmer, working tirelessly on his family estate, but he yearns for a life filled with culture, education, and love. He struggles to reconcile these two aspects of his life: the physical demands of his farm and the emotional and intellectual fulfillment he desires.

                Alyohin feels trapped by his responsibilities and doesn't actively seek a way to balance his work with the life he dreams of. Instead, he resigns himself to his toil, accepting that his duty to the estate prevents him from fully pursuing the things he loves. He reflects on his unfulfilled love for Anna, realizing that his life of work has kept him from experiencing true happiness. In the end, his plan to reconcile the two remains unresolved, as he continues to sacrifice personal joy for duty.<br><br>

            	e)&nbsp;In the poem Full Fathom Five by William Shakespeare, which is part of The Tempest, death is given a transformative and almost magical meaning. The poem describes a person who has drowned at sea, but instead of focusing on the sadness or finality of death, it presents death as a process of change and beauty. The person's body is transformed into something precious and eternal—the bones turn to coral, the eyes become pearls, and the sea’s mysterious forces create something beautiful from the remains.

                This transformation suggests that death is not the end, but rather a change into something new and lasting. Instead of being a sorrowful event, it is depicted as a natural and even wondrous process. In this way, death in the poem has a deeper, almost mystical meaning, representing the idea of rebirth and continuity within the cycles of nature.<br><br>

            	f)&nbsp;In A Story by Dylan Thomas, the boy's aunt leaves a message in the kitchen before going to her mother’s home that says, "I have gone to my mother's. Don't cook anything. Don't light the fire." This message reflects the aunt's frustration and desire to leave the responsibilities of the household behind, likely due to a disagreement or overwhelming circumstances. By leaving these instructions, she communicates a sense of finality and a desire for the boy and others in the household to not interfere with the usual routines until she returns. The note also symbolizes her temporary withdrawal from her duties and the household’s life.

            <div class="card card-body">
            	<p>
                a)&nbsp;In Women's Business, Lydia Pinkham emerges in the pages of newspapers and magazines as a savvy entrepreneur who promotes her homemade herbal remedies, specifically her Vegetable Compound, which she claims can cure a variety of ailments that affect women, particularly those related to menstruation and menopause.<br><br>

                To gain the trust of people, Pinkham presents herself as a caring, maternal figure who understands women's health issues in ways that male doctors might not. She shares personal advice, letters, and testimonials from satisfied customers, making her seem approachable and knowledgeable. Pinkham capitalizes on the distrust many women have towards the male-dominated medical profession at the time, positioning her remedies as natural, safe alternatives.<br><br>

                Her strategy is successful. Pinkham becomes a widely recognized figure, and her business grows significantly. The marketing techniques she uses, especially her personal connection with her audience through media, help her build a loyal customer base, and her product becomes one of the most popular patent medicines for women in the 19th century.<br><br>

                b)&nbsp;In James Joyce's The Boarding House, Mrs. Mooney, a shrewd and determined woman, runs a boarding house in Dublin after separating from her abusive husband. Her daughter, Polly, lives there and begins a romantic affair with Mr. Doran, one of the boarders. Mrs. Mooney strategically allows the relationship to develop, hoping it will lead to marriage and improve Polly’s social standing.<br><br>

                When the affair becomes known, Mrs. Mooney confronts Mr. Doran, pressuring him to propose to Polly. Feeling trapped by societal expectations and his fear of scandal, Mr. Doran reluctantly agrees to marry her, even though he has doubts. The story highlights themes of manipulation, social pressures, and moral ambiguity.

            	The way some people talk aloud in public transport shows a disregard for the shared space and the comfort of others. The way their voices rise above the ambient noise, filling the confined space with their conversations, can be distracting and intrusive. The way they seem unaware of, or indifferent to, the impact of their loud discussions on those around them reflects a lack of consideration. The way this behavior disrupts the peace of the journey can turn what should be a moment of quiet or reflection into an irritating experience. The way public transport is a common space should encourage mindfulness, not the monopolization of the airwaves by a few loud voices.
