				<h4 style="text-align: center;">The Duble Edged Sword of Social Media</h4>

				Social media platfons have become an undeniable force in our lives.They connect us with loved ones across the globe, provide instant access to information, and offer a platform for creative expression. However,the very features that make them appealing can also have a significant downside.
			</p>
			<p>
                On the positive side, social media fosters a sense of community. It allows us to reconnect with old friends, build new relationships based on shared interests,and engage in discussions with diverse viowpoints. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have empowered social movements, provided a voice to the marginalized,and facilitated real-time communication during emergencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                However.the constant barrage of information and carefully curated online personas can create feelings of inadequacy and social comparison. The pressure to maintain a "perfect" online image can negatively impact self-esteem, particularly among young people. Additionally, the echo chamber effect,where users are primarily exposed to coatent that confirms their existing beliefs,can exacerbate social polarization and hinder critical thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                The spread of misinformation is another major concern.Social media platforms ofien struggle to contain the proliferation of fke news and biased information, which can fuel distrust and manipulate public opinion.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ultimately,social media is a double-edged sword.It offers immense potential for connection and communication, but also carries the risk of addiction, isolation, and misinformation. As undergraduates, it's crucial to be mindful of these challenges and develop strategies for using social media responsibly and critically.

            	<p>
                	a)&nbsp;Social media helps create a sense of community by letting people reconnect with old friends, make new ones based on shared interests, and talk with others who have different opinions. It also supports social movements, gives a voice to those who might not be heard otherwise, and helps during emergencies.<br><br>

                	b)&nbsp;The spread of misinformation is a big problem because social media often has a hard time stopping the spread of fake news and biased information. This can make people distrustful, influence what they believe, and increase divisions in society.<br><br>

                	c)&nbsp;The passage says social media is good because it connects people worldwide, helps build communities, and supports social movements. But it can also be bad by making people feel insecure, lowering self-esteem, increasing social divisions, and spreading false information.<br><br>

                	d)&nbsp;The passage advises young people to be aware of the problems that come with social media, like addiction, feeling lonely, and encountering false information. It suggests they should use social media carefully and think critically about what they see.<br><br>

                	e)&nbsp;Examples of social media being empowering include its ability to support social movements, give a voice to marginalized people, and help in emergencies. Examples of it being harmful include the pressure to look perfect online, the echo chamber effect that limits critical thinking, and the spread of misinformation.

                	<p>
                		a)&nbsp;These lines are from Shakespeare's poem "All the World's a Stage." In this poem, life is compared to a play, and people are like actors on a stage. "Exits and entrances" refer to the moments when people are born (entrances) and when they die (exits). The line "one man in his time plays many parts" means that during a person’s life, they take on different roles or "parts," just like an actor does in a play. For example, a person might start as a child, then grow up to be a student, a worker, a parent, and so on. Each stage of life is like a new role in the play of life.<br><br>

                		a)&nbsp;Yes, it seems likely that Mrs. Wright murdered her husband. The play suggests that she was unhappy and isolated in her marriage. The discovery of the dead bird with a broken neck is a key clue. It symbolizes Mrs. Wright's own life, as she once loved to sing, but her husband was controlling and took away her happiness. The broken birdcage and the dead bird suggest that Mrs. Wright might have snapped and killed her husband in a moment of rage or desperation, just as her husband killed the bird.<br><br>

                		b)&nbsp;Aksinov was falsely accused of murdering a merchant with whom he had been traveling. The real murderer placed a bloody knife in Aksinov's bag, which led the police to believe that Aksinov was guilty. Despite his innocence, Aksinov was convicted and sent to prison for 26 years. The circumstances were tragic because Aksinov was a good man, and he had to suffer for a crime he didn’t commit.

                		Prithvi Narayan Shah, born in 1723, is a revered figure in Nepalese history, often called the "Father of Modern Nepal." He was the King of Gorkha and is most famous for unifying the small, fragmented kingdoms of Nepal into a single nation. Before his unification campaign, Nepal was divided into numerous small states, which made it vulnerable to external threats, especially from British India.<br><br>

                        Prithvi Narayan Shah ascended to the throne at a young age and quickly realized the importance of a united Nepal. His vision was clear: a strong, unified Nepal that could resist foreign invasions. He led numerous military campaigns, gradually conquering and merging the various small kingdoms, including the Kathmandu Valley, which was the heart of the country.<br><br>

                        He is also known for his famous saying, "Nepal is a garden of four castes and thirty-six tribes," emphasizing unity in diversity. Prithvi Narayan Shah died in 1775, but his legacy lives on, as he laid the foundation for the Nepal we know today.

                		<h4 style="text-align: center;">The Role of High School Students in Environmental Conservation</h4>
                        
                        Environmental conservation is a critical issue in today’s world, facing challenges such as climate change, pollution, and resource depletion. High school students, as the future leaders and influencers of society, play a crucial role in addressing these environmental challenges. Their involvement in conservation efforts can have significant impacts, fostering a culture of environmental responsibility and driving positive change in their communities.<br><br>

                        High school students can contribute to environmental conservation through various activities and initiatives. First, they can participate in or organize environmental awareness campaigns. By creating and disseminating information about the importance of protecting natural resources, students help educate their peers and the broader community. For instance, they might conduct workshops on recycling, energy conservation, and sustainable practices.<br><br>

                        Second, students can engage in hands-on conservation projects. Participating in local clean-up drives, tree planting events, and community gardening not only improves the environment but also instills a sense of personal responsibility. These activities can be coordinated through school clubs or community organizations, providing practical experience and fostering teamwork.<br><br>

                        Third, high school students can advocate for environmental policies and practices. By joining or forming student environmental groups, they can lobby for greener school policies, such as reducing plastic use and improving waste management. Their voices, combined with those of their peers, can influence school administration and local government to adopt more sustainable practices.<br><br>

                        In conclusion, high school students have a vital role in environmental conservation. Through awareness campaigns, hands-on projects, and advocacy, they can drive significant change and inspire others to join the cause. By embracing their role as environmental stewards, high school students contribute to building a more sustainable future, demonstrating that their efforts, no matter how small, can lead to meaningful environmental improvements.
