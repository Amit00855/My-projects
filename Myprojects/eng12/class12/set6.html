				The day after Thanksgiving is the start of the holiday shopping season.Thanksgiving is always on a Thursday, so the day after is Friday. This day has come to be known as Black Friday. Because it is a holiday in the United States, it has long been a popular day for <b>consumers</b> to start shopping for Christmas. It has been the busiest shopping day of the year since 2005.
			</p>
			<p>
                Most stores offer great deals on Black Friday. They open their doors in the wee hours of the morning. They try to attract shoppers with big discounts.Some items like TVs are much cheaper than usual. Stores may even lose money on these items. They hope that shoppers will buy gifts for other people while they are in the store. A surprising fact is that people in the USA spent an <b>estimated</b> $86.6 billion from November 1 to 24 in 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
                Black Friday is a great time to get good deals. The problem is that there are not enough low priced items to go around. Each store may only have a few.These items are in high demand. People stand in long lines to get such great deals. They may line up hours before a store opens. They may be hoping to get a low price on a TV or laptop, but not everyone who wants one will get one. Some people leave <b>disappointed</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of us love to get a <b>bargain</b>, but some feel that events like Black Friday encourage people to buy things that they don't really need and can't afford.Many people seem to completely lose control of both their spending and their tempers. The situation can be tense. Some Black Friday events have been <b>violent</b>. Large eager crowds have trampled workers. Fights have broken out over toys or people cutting in line. People have shot one another over each other over bargains. But most Black Friday events are safe and fun.
			</p>
			<p>
				Still, if you plan on going, expect large crowds and a bit of shoving. It is also argued that Black Friday is bad for smnall shopkeepers, who cannot afford to offer the kinds of price cuts that the big companies can.
			</p>
			<p>
                So, where does the name "Black Friday" come from ? It was first used in Philadelphia in the 1950s. The police called this day Black Friday because of the heavy traffic it drew. In the 1960s, stores tried to rename the day "Big Friday." It did not stick. The name "Black Friday" continued to <b>spread</b> across the country. It seems that it is here to stay.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, people all over the country take part in the event known as Black Friday. It is even spreading to other parts of the world.Stores have held Black Friday events in the U.K., Australia and Brazil since 2012. In Costa Rica, Black Friday is known as "Viernes Negro." And in Mexico, stores <b>offer</b> an annual weekend of discounts. They call it "El Buen Fin" which means "the good weekend" in Spanish.

                <p>
                	a)&nbsp;Mrs. Yang is portrayed as a compassionate and caring individual in "My Old Home." She shows kindness towards others, including Runtu and his family. Despite her difficult circumstances, she remains empathetic and helps those around her, which reflects her generous and selfless nature.<br><br>

                	b)&nbsp;The atmosphere of the celebration in the Varma family was one of mixed emotions. While there was a sense of pride and happiness due to Rakesh's achievements, there was also underlying tension and complexity in the family dynamics, especially as Rakesh's devotion to his parents took on a more controlling aspect.<br><br>

                	b)&nbsp;Marriage is often viewed as more beneficial to men because it traditionally grants them social and economic advantages. Men are typically seen as the heads of households, gaining status and control over family resources, while women are expected to take on domestic roles, which can limit their independence.<br><br>

                	c)&nbsp;The persona in the poem "I Was My Own Route" preferred a path of self-determination and independence. She rejected the traditional roles and expectations imposed by society and chose to carve her own way, embracing her individuality and freedom.<br><br>

                	d)&nbsp;The world needs more wisdom than knowledge in the future because wisdom involves the application of knowledge in a thoughtful, ethical, and compassionate manner. While knowledge provides information, wisdom helps navigate complex moral and social challenges, leading to better decision-making for the common good.<br><br>

                	d)&nbsp;The world needs more wisdom than knowledge in the future because wisdom encompasses the ability to discern right from wrong, understand the deeper implications of actions, and apply knowledge in a meaningful way. It fosters critical thinking and ethical behavior, which are crucial for addressing global issues.<br><br>

                	e)&nbsp;In "A Matter of Husbands," the Famous Actress convinces the Earnest Young Woman by explaining that the love letter was a mere prop to help the Actress's husband regain his affection for his wife. This clever explanation reassures the Earnest Young Woman that the letter was not a genuine romantic advance but a harmless ruse.<br><br>

                	<p>
                		a)&nbsp; In the story "The Half Closed Eyes of the Buddha and the Slowly Sinking Sun," the writer mentions the eyes of the Buddha, the sun, and the eyes of the people in different places, each with its own significance. The half-closed eyes of the Buddha symbolize a state of inner peace, serenity, and spiritual awakening, representing the timeless wisdom and calmness of the East. The slowly sinking sun symbolizes the passage of time and the decline of traditional values in the face of modernization. The eyes of the people, particularly those in the West, symbolize the materialistic outlook and restlessness that contrast with the spiritual focus of the East. I agree with their significance as mentioned in the story because these symbols effectively capture the contrasting values and philosophies between the East and the West, highlighting the need for a balance between material progress and spiritual fulfillment.<br><br>

                		a)&nbsp;"An Old Man with Enormous Wings" by Gabriel García Márquez is a story that masterfully blends realism with supernatural elements, creating a narrative that is both intriguing and thought-provoking. The story is set in a small, rural village where the mundane details of life are portrayed with great realism—poverty, the harshness of life, and the villagers' reactions to the old man. However, the supernatural element is introduced through the character of the old man with enormous wings, whose origin and nature are never fully explained. This combination creates a magical realism that allows the story to explore complex themes like human nature, compassion, and the absurdity of existence. The villagers' treatment of the old man reflects their fear and misunderstanding of the unknown, while the old man himself remains a mysterious figure, embodying both the mundane and the divine, the real and the surreal.<br><br>

                		b)&nbsp;The lines from the poem "The Awakening Age" by Ben Okri express a hopeful vision for a future where humanity transcends its current struggles and realizes a new era of enlightenment and peace. "O ye who travel the meridian line" refers to those who are journeying through life, possibly hinting at those in the prime of their lives or at a crossroads. The "vision of a new world" symbolizes the hope and potential for a better, more just world that could arise from the challenges and sufferings of the present. The "eyes that have lived with poverty's rage" represent those who have endured hardship and injustice, yet the poet wishes for them to see beyond their suffering and envision the "glory of the awakening age," a time of renewal, understanding, and progress. This passage encourages resilience and hope, suggesting that despite the struggles, a brighter future is possible if people can envision and work towards it.

                		Kathmandu, August 29, 2024: A large number of women staged demonstrations in Tinkune, Kathmandu, and Mangal Bazaar, Lalitpur, demanding the speedy resumption of water supply from the Melamchi Water Project. The project, which had been a lifeline for residents, was abruptly halted in June 2023, after previously providing much-needed relief in December 2022. The project, supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), had brought hope to thousands of households suffering from chronic water shortages.<br><br>

                        Parmila, a demonstrator at Tinkune, expressed the collective frustration, saying, "Why does the government turn a deaf ear to our demands?" The women, holding banners and chanting slogans, called on the government to prioritize the resumption of the project, which had brought temporary relief but now leaves them in dire need once again. The protest highlighted the urgent need for reliable water supply solutions in the Kathmandu Valley.

                		Choose any one of them given below.
                		<h4 style="text-align: center;">The Importance of Rules, Regulations, and Laws in Society</h4>
                        
                        Rules, regulations, and laws are fundamental to the functioning of any society. They establish order, protect rights, and ensure fairness, creating a framework that allows individuals to coexist peacefully. Without these structures, society would likely descend into chaos, as individuals acting solely on personal desires could disrupt the collective harmony. I firmly agree that societies based on rules, regulations, and laws are essential for their smooth functioning.<br><br>

                        Firstly, rules and laws maintain social order. In a society where everyone is free to do whatever they want, conflicts and disputes would be inevitable. For instance, without traffic laws, the streets would be dangerous, with drivers acting on impulse, leading to accidents and fatalities. Similarly, without laws against theft, people could take others' property without consequences, undermining the sense of security necessary for a community to thrive.<br><br>

                        Secondly, laws protect the rights and freedoms of individuals. While it might seem appealing to have absolute freedom, this would often come at the expense of others. For example, freedom of speech is a fundamental right, but without regulations, it could lead to hate speech or incitement of violence, harming vulnerable groups. Laws create a balance, allowing individuals to exercise their rights without infringing on the rights of others.<br><br>

                        Moreover, rules and regulations ensure fairness and equality in society. They provide a standard by which everyone is judged, regardless of their status or power. In the absence of laws, the powerful could exploit the weak, leading to a society where might makes right, and justice is arbitrary. By enforcing laws, society ensures that everyone is held accountable to the same standards, promoting justice and equity.<br><br>

                        In conclusion, societies based on rules, regulations, and laws are crucial for maintaining order, protecting individual rights, and ensuring fairness. While complete freedom might seem ideal in theory, it would likely lead to chaos and inequality in practice. Therefore, it is essential to have a structured legal system to support the well-being and prosperity of society.

                    	<h4 style="text-align: center;">Importance of Rules and Regulations in Society</h4>
                    	Rules, regulations, and laws form the foundation of any functioning society. They establish order, protect individuals, and ensure that society operates smoothly. Without these guiding principles, chaos would likely ensue, leading to a breakdown of social structures. I firmly agree with the statement that if individuals were free to do whatever they wanted, society couldn’t function well.<br><br>

                        In any society, rules and laws exist to protect the rights and safety of individuals. Without them, people's actions might infringe on the rights of others. For instance, laws against theft, assault, or fraud protect citizens from harm. If individuals could act solely based on their desires, there would be no accountability, and society would face widespread conflicts and instability.<br><br>

                        Moreover, rules help create fairness and equality within society. For example, labor laws ensure fair wages and working conditions for employees. Environmental regulations protect nature from exploitation. Without these laws, the more powerful individuals or corporations could exploit the less privileged, leading to social and economic inequalities.<br><br>

                        Furthermore, regulations ensure that public services, such as transportation, healthcare, and education, are organized and accessible to all. If there were no traffic laws, roads would be dangerous and unpredictable. Similarly, the absence of rules in healthcare could lead to unfair access to medical treatment, compromising public health.<br><br>

                        However, while rules and regulations are essential, they must be fair, just, and adaptable. Societies evolve, and so should their laws. Laws that are too rigid or outdated can stifle creativity and innovation. A balance between individual freedom and societal order is necessary for progress.<br><br>

                        In conclusion, rules and regulations are critical for a society to function efficiently. They ensure fairness, protect rights, and maintain order. While individual freedom is important, it must be guided by a framework of laws to prevent chaos and maintain harmony within society.
