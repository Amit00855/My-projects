				For centuries, time was measured by the position of the Sun with the use of sundials.Noon was recognised when the Sun was the highest in the sky,and cities would set their clock by this <b>apparent</b> solar time, even though some cities would often be on a slightly different time.Daylight Saving Time (DST),sometimes called summer time,was instituted to make better use of daylight.Thus,clocks are set forward one hour in the spring to move an hour of daylight from the morning to the evening and then set back one hour in the fall to return to normal daylight.
			</p>
			<p>
				Benjamin Franklin first <b>conceived</b> the idea of daylight saving during his tenure as an American delegate in Paris in 1984 and wrote about it extnsively in his éssay,"An Economical Project." It is said that Franklin awoke early one morning and was surprised to see the sunlight at such an hour. Always on the use of candlelight,as candles were expensive at the time.
			</p>
			<p>
				In England, builder William Willet(1957-1915) became a strong supporter for Daylight Saving Time upon noticing blinds of many houses were closed appreciate longer hours of light in the evenings.In 1909,Sir Robert Pearce introduced a bill in the House of Commons to make it <b>obligatory</b> to adjust the clocks. A bill was drafted and introduced into Parliament several times was decided that summer times
				but met with great opposition, mostly from farmers. Eventually, in 1925, it was decided that summer time should begin on the day following the third Saturday in April and close after the first Saturday in October.
			</p>
			<p>
				The U.S.congress passed the standard Time Act of 1918 to cstablish standard time and <b>preserve</b> and set Daylight saving Time across the continent. This act also devised five time Zones throughout United States: Eastern, central, Mountain,Pacific,and Alaska.The first time zone was set on "the mean astronomical time of the seventy-fifth degree of longitude west from Greenwich"(England). In 1919,this act was cancel1ed.
			</p>
			<p>
			    President Roosevelt established year-round Daylight saving Time(also callled War Time) from 1942-1945.However,after this period,each state <b>adopted</b> its own DST, which provided to be <b>disconcerting</b> to television and radio broadcasting and transportation. In 1996,President Lyndon Johnson <b>created</b> result,the Department of transportation was given the responsibility for the time laws. During the oil embargo and energy crisis of the 1970s, President Richard Nixon extended DST through the Daylight Saving Time Energy Act of 1973 to conserve cnergy further. This law was modified in 1986, and Daylight Saving Time was reset to begin on the first Sunday in April (to spring ahead) and end on the last Sunday in October (to fall back).

                <p>
                	a)&nbsp;The writer returned home after twenty years to visit his old village and reflect on his past. The visit was prompted by a longing to reconnect with his roots and relive the memories associated with his childhood. However, upon returning, he was confronted with the reality of change, both in the physical landscape and in the people he once knew. This visit served as a journey of introspection, exploring themes of nostalgia, change, and the passage of time.<br><br>

                	b)&nbsp;The author notes that Nepal has given the West many things, including spiritual wisdom, a deep sense of peace, and the teachings of Buddhism, which emphasize inner tranquility and mindfulness. Nepal's rich cultural heritage, symbolized by the image of the Buddha's half-closed eyes, has offered the West insights into meditation, the importance of living in harmony with nature, and the pursuit of spiritual fulfillment over material wealth.<br><br>

                	b)&nbsp;The author was biased towards science because of his strong belief in its ability to explain the natural world and improve human life. He admired science for its systematic approach to understanding the universe and its practical applications that have led to technological advancements. This bias was also fueled by the belief that science, through libraries, could provide knowledge and answers to life's big questions, making it a powerful tool for progress and enlightenment.<br><br>

                	c)&nbsp;The poet refers to the Earth as the "poor creature" in the poem "Every Morning I Wake" because of the immense suffering it endures due to human exploitation and environmental degradation. The Earth is personified as a being that bears the weight of pollution, deforestation, and climate change, which are the consequences of human greed and carelessness. The poet's choice of words reflects a deep sympathy for the Earth, emphasizing the need for humanity to recognize and correct its harmful actions.<br><br>

                	d)&nbsp;The author concludes that morality, art, spirituality, and creativity are universal human abilities embedded in our DNA based on the observation that these traits are present across all cultures and societies, regardless of geographic or historical differences. These abilities appear to be inherent in human nature, influencing how we express ourselves, form ethical beliefs, seek meaning, and create beauty. This universality suggests that such traits are fundamental aspects of being human, deeply rooted in our evolutionary history.<br><br>

                	d)&nbsp;I agree with the author that wisdom is more important than knowledge because wisdom involves the application of knowledge in a thoughtful, ethical, and compassionate manner. While knowledge is the accumulation of facts and information, wisdom is the ability to use that knowledge to make sound decisions, solve problems, and navigate the complexities of life. Wisdom encompasses experience, insight, and understanding, making it essential for leading a balanced and meaningful life.<br><br>

                	e)&nbsp;In the play "A Matter of Husbands," the letter plays a crucial role as a prop used by the actress to manipulate and deceive the young wife. The letter is supposedly from the young wife's husband, suggesting an affair between him and the actress. However, the actress reveals that the letter was a trick to test the husband's loyalty and that no affair actually took place. The letter thus serves as a plot device to explore themes of trust, deception, and the complexity of human relationships.<br><br>

I would initiate programs that promote gender equality, offer platforms for women to share their voices, and provide resources for education and career development. Additionally, I would support artistic and cultural initiatives that encourage women to explore and express their creativity, thereby fostering a society that values and respects their autonomy and individuality.<br><br>

                		b)&nbsp;I believe Monsieur Durand's decision at the end of the play "Facing Death" was a desperate and tragic act driven by his overwhelming sense of responsibility and hopelessness. While his actions were extreme, they were rooted in his desire to protect his daughters from poverty and dishonor. However, I don't believe it was the right step, as it ultimately denied his daughters the chance to face challenges and build their own futures. His decision reflects the complex moral dilemmas faced by those in desperate circumstances, but it also underscores the importance of seeking alternative solutions and support systems.<br><br>

                		b)&nbsp;Runtu’s case in Chinese society, as depicted in "My Old Home," highlights the struggles of the lower class in a society undergoing significant change. Similarly, the living conditions of average Nepali people are a mix of improvements and ongoing challenges. On one hand, access to education, healthcare, and infrastructure has improved in many parts of Nepal. For example, rural areas now have better access to roads and communication, which has enhanced connectivity and economic opportunities. On the other hand, issues like unemployment, political instability, and economic disparity persist, which hinder overall progress. Therefore, while there have been improvements, many Nepali people still face significant challenges, suggesting that while conditions are improving in some areas, there is still a long way to go for widespread betterment.

                        Udayapur Cement Factory regrets to inform our valued customers, distributors, and stakeholders that there will be a temporary delay in the production and distribution of our highest quality cement.
