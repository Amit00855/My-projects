		<b>1. &nbsp; Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow. (15)</b>
	</p>
		<div class="que1">
			<p>
				The condition of environment is a matter of great alarm and concern today. The environmental conditions have degenerated to such an extent that it has become a worldwide issue. Pollution at all levels, that is, air, water and soil knows no bounds. As if this is not enough, the whole ecological system has been disturbed because of man's urge to control nature. The extinction of a number of rare species, depletion of ozone and wide deforestation forcing the creatures of the wild to territories of men (and hence disturbing the balance of the ecological system) are only some examples. 
			</p>
			<p>
				There is a distinction between the environmental threats faced by the developed nations, such as the United States and Western European Countries, and the developing nations, such as India and Mexico. Whatever the nature of the crisis, most of the environmental problems faced by the developed nations are the result of the overconsumption whereas the problems faced by the under developed and developing countries are the result of under consumption. It is usually said that the people in the poor nations fall ill because they are undernourished whereas the rich counterparts in the first world fall ill because they overeat. Same is the case with the environmental problems. The Americans and to a lesser extent, Western Europeans, Japanese and other residents of developed nations, are more likely to own one or more cars, purchase more food and clothes than subsistence levels require, and use considerable amounts of electricity. As a result, there is more pollution, creating environmental problems.

                 View Answer</a>
                <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample2">
                <div class="card card-body">
                	<p>
                	a)&nbsp;The central idea of Gerard Manley Hopkins' poem "God's Grandeur" is the enduring presence of God's divine power and beauty in the world, despite humanity's constant efforts to harm and exploit nature. The poem emphasizes that, although people have marred the Earth through industrialization and neglect, the natural world still reflects God's grandeur, and His divine spirit continues to renew and sustain it.<br><br>

                	b)&nbsp;The day started with a heavy heart, knowing what lay ahead, yet the scenery outside held a deceptive calm. As we walked through the meadows, the sun cast a golden hue on the grass, and the birds sang as if nothing was amiss. The sound of the river in the distance seemed to echo the steady rhythm of our footsteps, a rhythm that matched the beating of my anxious heart. I tried to focus on the beauty around me, but the looming sense of dread shadowed every thought, every step. The journey felt like a final farewell, the landscape a silent witness to the burden I carried.<br><br>

                	c)&nbsp;In W.B. Yeats' play "Purgatory," the old man's motive for murdering the boy is deeply rooted in his desire to end the cycle of suffering and sin that has plagued his family. The old man believes that by killing the boy, who is his own son, he is preventing him from repeating the mistakes of the past, specifically those of his mother. The old man sees this act as a way to purify his family's legacy and to break free from the curse that has haunted them, even though it comes at the cost of his son's life.<br><br>

                	d)&nbsp;The people of Karnali, a remote region in Nepal, lead a life that is deeply connected to the harsh and challenging environment in which they live. Their daily lives are marked by subsistence farming, trading, and a strong reliance on traditional practices and beliefs. The mountainous terrain and lack of infrastructure make life difficult, with limited access to modern amenities and services. The people are resilient, adapting to the challenges of their environment, but their lives are also marked by poverty and a constant struggle for survival. Despite the hardships, there is a strong sense of community and a deep connection to their cultural heritage.<br><br>

                	e)&nbsp;In Anton Chekhov's story "About Love," three distinct dimensions of love are explored through the experiences of the characters:<br><br>

                    Romantic Love:&nbsp; This is represented by the passionate, unfulfilled love that Alyohin feels for Anna, a love that is intense yet restrained by social conventions and personal circumstances.<br><br>

                    Compassionate Love:&nbsp; This is the deep, empathetic love that grows from understanding and shared experiences. Alyohin's love for Anna also encompasses this dimension, as he cares deeply for her well-being and happiness, even at the cost of his own desires.<br><br>

                    Sacrificial Love:&nbsp; The story also highlights the aspect of love that involves personal sacrifice. Alyohin sacrifices his own happiness by choosing not to act on his feelings for Anna, understanding that doing so would disrupt her life and social standing.<br><br>

                	f)&nbsp;Mrs. Mooney, a central character in James Joyce's "The Boarding House," is portrayed as a shrewd, determined, and calculating woman. After separating from her abusive husband, she successfully runs a boarding house, demonstrating her strong will and resourcefulness. Mrs. Mooney is pragmatic, using her daughter Polly as a means to secure a better social and financial position for the family. She carefully orchestrates events to ensure that Polly's relationship with Mr. Doran leads to marriage, revealing her manipulative and strategic nature. Despite her seemingly harsh and controlling personality, Mrs. Mooney's actions are driven by a desire to protect her family's future and ensure their survival in a challenging environment.

            <div class="card card-body">
            	<p>
                	a)&nbsp;As the sun begins to set on the horizon of life, an old man sits quietly in his favorite armchair, memories swirling around him like autumn leaves caught in a gentle breeze. His eyes, though clouded with age, still hold the light of experiences long past, each wrinkle on his face a testament to the passage of time and the stories it has woven into the fabric of his existence.<br><br>

                    He remembers the days of his youth with a bittersweet smile—the boundless energy, the sense of invincibility, and the dreams that seemed just within reach. The old man recalls running through fields with friends, the wind whipping through his hair as laughter echoed in the air. Those were the days when the world seemed so vast and full of promise, and every new experience was a discovery waiting to be made.<br><br>

                    As he grew older, life took on new responsibilities and challenges. The old man remembers the struggles of building a career, the long hours of hard work, and the sacrifices made along the way. He recalls the love he found in a partner who stood by his side through thick and thin, the joys of parenthood, and the bittersweet moments of watching his children grow up and forge their own paths in life. He can still feel the warmth of the family gatherings, the laughter shared around the dinner table, and the quiet comfort of knowing that he was surrounded by loved ones.<br><br>

                    But along with the happiness, the old man also remembers the sorrows that life brought—losses that left a deep ache in his heart, mistakes that could not be undone, and regrets that still linger in the corners of his mind. He thinks of the friends and loved ones who have passed on, their absence leaving a void that time has not been able to fill. Yet, even in these moments of reflection, there is a sense of peace, a recognition that these experiences, both good and bad, have shaped the person he has become.<br><br>

                    Now, in the twilight of his years, the old man finds solace in the quiet moments of reflection. He knows that the days ahead are fewer than those behind, but there is a sense of contentment in knowing that he has lived a full life. He carries with him the wisdom of age, a deep understanding of the ebb and flow of existence, and a profound appreciation for the simple joys that life still offers.<br><br>

                    As the old man closes his eyes, he is surrounded by the echoes of his memories—each one a piece of the puzzle that is his life. And as he drifts off to sleep, there is a gentle smile on his face, for he knows that, in the end, it is the memories we hold dear that keep us company as we journey into the unknown.<br><br>

                	b)&nbsp;Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, delivered during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963, is one of the most iconic and influential speeches in American history. King's speech articulated his dreams of a nation where equality, justice, and freedom would be the birthright of every citizen, regardless of race. His dreams were rooted in the principles of the American Declaration of Independence and were driven by a vision of a better, more just society.<br><br>

                    One of King's central dreams was the end of racial segregation and discrimination. He envisioned a day when the color of one's skin would no longer determine one's rights, opportunities, or social standing. King dreamed of a world where African Americans, who had long been oppressed and marginalized, would be able to live with dignity, pride, and the same freedoms as their white counterparts. This dream was a call for an end to the systemic racism that had plagued the United States for centuries.<br><br>

                    King's dream also extended to the idea of economic equality. He recognized that true freedom could not exist without economic justice. He spoke of a world where everyone, regardless of race, would have access to jobs, education, and the resources needed to live a prosperous and fulfilling life. He dreamed of a society where poverty and inequality were eradicated, and where all people could achieve the American Dream.<br><br>

                    Another powerful aspect of King's dream was the idea of unity and brotherhood. He envisioned a future where people of all races, religions, and backgrounds could come together in harmony, recognizing their shared humanity. King dreamed of a day when the nation would rise above the divisions of race and prejudice, and where love and understanding would replace hatred and bigotry. This vision of unity was a fundamental part of King's belief in the power of nonviolent resistance and peaceful coexistence.<br><br>

                    King's dreams were deeply rooted in his faith and moral convictions. He believed that justice was not just a legal concept, but a moral imperative that required action from every individual. His dream was a call to the conscience of the nation, urging people to stand up for what was right, to challenge injustice wherever it existed, and to work towards a society that reflected the ideals of freedom, equality, and brotherhood.<br><br>

                    In conclusion, Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech articulated a powerful and enduring vision of a better world. His dreams of racial equality, economic justice, unity, and moral righteousness continue to inspire generations of people around the world. King's speech remains a testament to the power of words to move hearts and minds, and his dreams continue to serve as a guiding light in the ongoing struggle for justice and equality.

                	<p>
                	Answer:&nbsp;Mobile phones offer numerous advantages, such as facilitating instant communication through calls, texts, and messaging apps, which helps people stay connected regardless of distance. They are incredibly convenient, consolidating various functions like internet access, navigation, and productivity tools into a single device, thus simplifying daily tasks. In emergencies, mobile phones provide a quick way to contact emergency services, potentially saving lives. They also serve as sources of entertainment, offering access to music, videos, and social media, while their productivity features, such as calendars and reminders, aid in managing schedules and tasks efficiently.<br><br>

                    However, mobile phones also come with notable disadvantages. They can be highly distracting, often leading to reduced focus and productivity in work or academic environments. Privacy concerns arise as mobile phones are susceptible to hacking, data theft, and unauthorized tracking. Prolonged use may result in health issues like eye strain and poor posture, and there are ongoing debates about potential effects from electromagnetic radiation. Socially, excessive phone use can contribute to isolation, as individuals might prefer virtual interactions over face-to-face communication. Additionally, the costs associated with purchasing a mobile phone and maintaining service plans can be significant, adding to the financial burden for many users.

                	Hey, I just got back from my holiday, and honestly, it was nothing like I expected. I had imagined relaxing days on beautiful beaches and exploring vibrant local markets, but instead, the weather was gloomy and rainy almost the entire time. The hotel wasn’t as nice as the pictures had shown, and the service was pretty lackluster. The local attractions were overcrowded and didn’t quite live up to their hype. It felt like a real letdown compared to what I had envisioned. I was hoping for a refreshing getaway, but it ended up being more stressful than relaxing.
